# Item System Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Item Sprite Display

**Problem:** Items on the ground were showing as colored rectangles instead of their actual sprites.

**Solution:** 
- Modified the item drawing system to properly use individual item sprite names
- Added fallback sprite loading with proper prefixes (`weapon_`, `armor_`)
- Instead of colored rectangles, items now display:
  - Their specific sprite if available (e.g., `dagger`, `short_sword1`)
  - Generic item sprites as fallback
  - Item name abbreviation with background if no sprite found

**Technical Details:**
- Items now check for `sprite_name` attribute and look for sprites with proper prefixes
- Weapon sprites use keys like `weapon_dagger`, `weapon_short_sword1`
- Armor sprites use keys like `armor_leather_armour1`, `armor_chain_mail1`

### 2. Single Player Duplicate Prevention

**Problem:** In single player mode, players could find multiple copies of the same unique items.

**Solution:**
- Added `obtained_items` tracking system for single player games
- Prevents duplicate item generation in treasure chests, enemy drops, and floor loot
- Items are marked as obtained when picked up
- Save/load system preserves obtained items list

**Technical Details:**
- `Dungeon` class now has `obtained_items` set to track found items
- `is_single_player` flag determines when to apply duplicate prevention
- Item generation methods filter out already obtained items
- Starting equipment is automatically added to obtained items

### 3. Item Instance Management

**Problem:** Items were being referenced instead of copied, causing multiple references to the same object.

**Solution:**
- All item generation now creates new instances using copy constructors
- Treasure chests, enemy drops, and floor loot all create fresh item instances
- Prevents item state issues and inventory conflicts

### 4. Save System Integration

**Features Added:**
- `obtained_items` list is saved and loaded with game state
- Single player sessions preserve item discovery across saves
- Reset functionality properly clears obtained items for new games

## How It Works

### For Single Player:
1. When starting a new game, `obtained_items` set is initialized
2. Starting weapons/armor are added to obtained items
3. During dungeon generation, available items are filtered to exclude obtained ones
4. When items are picked up, they're added to the obtained items set
5. Save/load preserves the obtained items list

### For Multiplayer:
- Duplicate prevention is disabled (multiple players can find same items)
- All items remain available throughout the game

### Item Display Priority:
1. Specific item sprite (e.g., `weapon_katana`)
2. Generic category sprite (e.g., `item_weapon`)
3. Text abbreviation with background (e.g., "KAT" for Katana)

## Files Modified

- `rpg_pygame.py`: Main game file with all improvements
- `ITEM_IMPROVEMENTS.md`: This documentation file

## Testing

The system has been tested to ensure:
- Items display with proper sprites
- Single player duplicate prevention works
- Save/load preserves obtained items
- No crashes or errors during gameplay
- Fallback display works when sprites are missing
